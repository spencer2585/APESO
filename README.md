APESO Integration

**DOES NOT WORK**

APWorld is set up for wayshrines in the daggerfall covenent Regions as locations and access to regions as items
Game mod is set up to read current characters alliance, read when the character descovers a wayshrine and lock regions

There is a basic client but it only works as a text client. as such there is no connection to the game and it cannot send or recive items
